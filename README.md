# BLOG- Flight Fare Prediction
Capstone Project Article Submission
In this Article, I will be guiding you to the step-by-step procedure in building a Machine Learning model in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy, Pandas  & scikit-learn to predict Domestic Flight fares in India. 
We have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Although We cannot change the fact about rising fuel prices, there are some factors according to which we can predict the Prices of the flight and arrange the travel accordingly. In this Article, I have built the model predicting flight fares using the dataset of prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. Dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/dsrscientist/Data-Science-ML-Capstone-Projects/blob/master/Flight_Ticket_Participant_Datasets-20190305T100527Z-001.zip
There are 2 datasets in the link, Train and Test Dataset. 
Size of training set: 10683 records
Size of test set: 2671 records
Using the Training set, I have built the model and predicted the Flight fares in the Test dataset.
